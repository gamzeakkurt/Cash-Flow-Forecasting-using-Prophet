# Cash-Flow-Forecasting-using-Prophet

This project was made for Shell Net Cash Flow Datathon. With this project,  8th place was achieved in the competition. All information about Shell Datathon is in the Kaggle.

**General Information about code:**

We forecasted net cash flow prediction for 70 days. We analyzed the data and we used the Prophet model for predictions. All information and explanation are in the Jupyter Notebook.
We can not share the data because of privacy.  Also, we made a Web application for this project using Streamlit. In the Web app, you can only import the 2 CSV files and select the forecasting day. 
The application calculates and shows the result for you. Also, you can download the forecasting results.
