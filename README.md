# Cash-Flow-Forecasting-using-Prophet

In this project, we forecasted net cash flow prediction for 70 days. We analyzed the data and we used the Prophet model for predictions. All information and explanation are in the Jupyter Notebook.
We can not share the data because of privacy.  Also, we made a Web application for this project using Streamlit. In the Web app, you can only import the 2 CSV files and select the forecasting day. 
The application calculates and shows the result for you. Also, you can download the forecasting results.
